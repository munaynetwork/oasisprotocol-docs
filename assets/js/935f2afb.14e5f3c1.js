It allows one to initialize a node from a trusted height, its corresponding block\'s header and a trusted validator set (given in the genesis document). It does so by securely updating the node\'s trusted state by requesting and verifying a minimal set of data from the network\'s full nodes.","sidebar":"docs"},"run-a-node/advanced/using-ledger-backed-consensus-key-with-a-remote-signer":{"id":"run-a-node/advanced/using-ledger-backed-consensus-key-with-a-remote-signer","title":"Using Ledger-backed Consensus Key with a Remote Signer","description":"This guide will describe how you can set up your validator node with a detached consensus key stored on a Ledger wallet connected via Oasis Core\'s Remote Signer.","sidebar":"docs"},"run-a-node/maintenance-guides/adding-or-removing-nodes":{"id":"run-a-node/maintenance-guides/adding-or-removing-nodes","title":"Adding or Removing Nodes","description":"At some point you may wish to add or remove nodes from your entity.
